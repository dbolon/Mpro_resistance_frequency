Analysis of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 isolates for mutations with drug resistance potential
Based on identification of mutations with significant drug resistance and/or hyperactivity
in yeast-based deep mutational scans.
Sequenced isolates were obtained from the September 7, 2023 release that is described in 
the article at the link below. 
https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msab264
We plan further analyses and regular updates to provide ongoing surveylance of 
emerging resistance to Mpro inhibitors in circulating variants.
